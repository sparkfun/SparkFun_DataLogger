## SparkFun DataLogger IoT Firmware - Version 1.2

January 2026

### New Features and Enhancements

#### New Device Support

Support for the following new SparkFun qwiic devices

- [SparkFun Air Quality PM1/PM2.5/PM10 Sensor - BMV080 (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-air-quality-pm1-pm2-5-pm10-sensor-bmv080-qwiic.html)
- [SparkFun Spectral Sensor - AS7343 (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-spectral-sensor-as7343-qwiic.html)

#### UART Data Logging

Connect an external uart/serial device to the DataLogger IoT board and any input recieved from that device is output within the current logging stream (Serial console, SD Card, IoT endpoint ...)

#### Log Values from an Analog Pin

Connect an anlog device/sensor to a specified DataLogger GPIO pin and the data value is written to the current log stream/output.

#### Support for the SparkFun Analog Soil Mosture Sensor

Connect the [SparkFun Soil Moisture Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-soil-moisture-sensor.html) to the specified/selected (via menu system) GPIO pins of the DataLogger IoT board and the senor values are output to the output log stream.

> Note - the qwiic Soil Moisture Sensor is not supported by the DataLogger IoT due to I2C bus incompatablity (i2c clock stretching)

#### Trigger Logging via Interrupt

When enabled, with an interrupt connected to a specified (in the menu system) DataLogger IoT GPIO pin, a logging event is triggered when the interrupt is fired.

#### Trigger Logging using the PPS signal from a GNSS device

When enabld and the GNSS device PPS signal is connected to a specified GPIO pin on the DataLogger IoT, a logging event is triggered when the PPS signal is sent.

### General Improvements

- Fixed issues with the ISO8601 date formatting in the logging system
- Improved support for verbose logging via the menu system
- Fixed issue with epoch tick output values
- Can now add the log-event trigger source to the log-stream output.

And this new functionality is available today at the DataLogger [repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_DataLogger) as a beta release.  The update is free, available as a file uploaded via an SD Card.  Just select the “System Update” option within the DataLogger IoT menu system and select your desired upgrade option.
