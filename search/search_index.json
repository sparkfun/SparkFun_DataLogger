In this case, we were using the DataLogger IoT using the Qwiic Environmental Combo Breakout - ENS160/BME280. of course, you could have other compatible Qwiic-enabled devices connected depending on your setup. For simplicity, a WiFi connection was used to synchronize the clock to the NTP server and a computer's USB port was used to power everything.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>For users without an Internet connection to sync the clock to the NTP server, you may want to consider using a compatible Qwiic-enabled device like the Qwiic Real Time Clock (RTC) Module - RV-8803 or a Qwiic-enabled u-blox GNSS module. Note that you will need to configure the time to your area before logging any data. U-blox GNSS modules would also need to be able to view a few satellites before being able to synchronize to the UTC.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>For users that require a timestamp with their datasets, make sure to enable timestamp.</p>"},{"location":"single_page/#download-the-log-files","title":"Download the Log Files","text":"<p>Users can download the log files to your computer with the IoT Web Server.
